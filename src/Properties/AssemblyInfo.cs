// Version information for an assembly consists of the following four values:
//
//      Major Version
//      Minor Version 
//      Build Number
//      Revision
//
// You can specify all the values or you can default the Build and Revision Numbers 
// by using the '*' as shown below:

// Manually change major/minor/build (let revision auto-increment).
//
// Note:  AssemblyFileVersion is commented out so that it automatically is set
//        to be the same as AssemblyVersion.  Technically the AssemblyFileVersion
//        is the one that should be incremented with builds/releases and the 
//        AssemblyVersion should only be changed if it breaks backwards compatibility
//        of clients or has new API.  But, this app doesn't have a public API or
//        clients and the AssemblyFileVersion doesn't support the .* syntax for
//        auto-incrementing build/revision.
